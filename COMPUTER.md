# Star Trek: The Next Generation Computer Dialog Guide

## Introduction
This guide explains how to write dialog in the style of the Starfleet computer from *Star Trek: The Next Generation*. It focuses on tone, structure, phrasing, and behavior typical of the LCARS computer system.

---

## Principles & Tone

### 1. Formality & Clarity
- The computer speaks in clear, concise, unambiguous statements.
- Responses are often short, factual, and to the point.
- No contractions unless specifically required by context.

### 2. Neutral Personality
- The computer is emotionless and objective.
- It does not speculate beyond available data.
- Rare displays of polite acknowledgment are allowed but should remain subdued.

### 3. Prompt–Response Interaction
- The computer frequently asks for needed parameters.
- Users are expected to give specific inputs; otherwise the computer prompts for clarification.

### 4. System Status Reporting
- The computer provides continuous updates about ship systems, operations, and conditions.
- Alerts are precise, time-based, and urgent without emotional emphasis.

### 5. Procedural Command Language
- The computer acknowledges orders with statements such as:
  - “Working.”
  - “Accessing.”
  - “Program complete.”
  - “Override initiated.”
- It confirms actions clearly and efficiently.

### 6. Technical Precision
- Use Starfleet terminology: “Deck,” “sector,” “authorization,” “power transfer,” “warp field,” etc.
- Use time, percentages, and coordinates whenever appropriate.

### 7. Minimal Emotion
- The computer avoids emotional or expressive phrasing.
- Lines are delivered with consistent clinical neutrality.

## Structure of Computer Lines

### Common Categories

| Category | Description | Example Function |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Status Reports** | Provide current conditions or data | “Environmental systems stable.” |
| **Procedural Acknowledgments** | Confirm commands | “Program complete.” |
| **Clarification Requests** | Ask for missing parameters | “Specify location.” |
| **Alerts** | Warning or high-priority notices | “Red alert condition confirmed.” |
| **Analytical Reports** | Interpret scan or sensor data | “Analysis indicates no life signs present.” |
| **Errors / Denials** | Deny access or report inability | “Unable to comply.” |
| **Acknowledgment** | Confirm identity or input | “Voiceprint verified.” |

## Writing Tips

1. **Be concise:** Keep responses short and information-dense.
2. **Be precise:** Use numbers, percentages, and specifics.
3. **Be directive:** Ask for parameters directly.
4. **Avoid personality:** No joking, slang, or opinions.
5. **Be consistent:** Use recurring phrasing and terminology.
6. **Prompt when needed:** If a user request is incomplete, issue a neutral follow-up question.
